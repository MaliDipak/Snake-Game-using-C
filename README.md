# Rock Paper Scissors Game in C
## Discription :-
    Here, I have made "Snake Game" game using 
    C language. This is my third mini project.

This is a console based snake game.\
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food ('@'), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up ('w'), down ('z'), left ('a'), or right ('s')), and the snake's body follows.
